# ReactTimerApp

In this React Timer project, You can specify a session and break duration that will alternate, and once either the session or break countdown reaches zero, a new countdown will start based on the value set in the session/break length label.

Implemented by using features such as useReducer for states management and useContext for global accessibility.
